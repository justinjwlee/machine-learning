# Machine Learning Implementations

This repo contains basic Machine Learning implementations in the follow languages: 

- Matlab & Octave
- R
- Python

Most of the boilerplates for standard problems are covered: linear regression, logistic regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines etc.

## Topics covered

_1. Linear regression_
- Univariate and multivariate
- Gradient Descent
- Feature Scaling
 
_2. Logistic regression_

> Most of the resource in Matlab were obtained from Coursera Stanford Machine Learning Course
